Because you're working for a large enterprise, you want to script your work so that you can reuse it in several datacenters and several Synergy environments. Your scripting language of choice is PowerShell. Your guide to best practices for vSphere VSAN on HPE Synergy is [this technical white paper](https://support.hpe.com/hpesc/public/docDisplay?docLocale=en_US&docId=emr_na-a00060084en_us)\n",
