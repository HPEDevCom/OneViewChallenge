Because you're working for a large enterprise, you want to script your work so that you can reuse it in several datacenters and several Synergy environments. Your scripting language of choice is PowerShell. Your guide to best practices for vSphere VSAN on HPE Synergy is [this technical white paper](https://support.hpe.com/hpesc/public/docDisplay?docLocale=en_US&docId=emr_na-a00060084en_us)\n",

    "- Step 1: Commit changes in your Jupyter environment  (again using your Launcher terminal window)\n",
    "- Step 2: Push changes to your repo  (still using your Launcher terminal window)\n",
    "- Step 3: Open a Pull Request (PR) on our original repo. Make sure you provide an email in the description of the PR so we can contact you if your submission has been chosen. (This step is done from your GitHub account).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Open PR](Pictures/NewPullRequest.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You should submit your response within the 4-hour time slot. We will reset all the Jupyter accounts right after the time is up, so make sure you have at least committed and pushed your changes back to your repo prior to that. You will then have more time to submit your PR.\n",

We have set up a Slack channel in the HPE DEV Slack Workspace. Feel free to [join the workspace](https://slack.hpedev.io/) then [start asking questions there](https://hpedev.slack.com/archives/C015CLE2QTT). We will be around to help you.\n",
